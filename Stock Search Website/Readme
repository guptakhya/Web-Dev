Created a static (non-responsive) HTML page that would take a stock ticker as the user input and then fetch details by making
multiple async API calls (Flask) and converting result to required data in JSON. 
Dynamically shows either an error message or brings up a nav bar and a table with company details with the option to switch to tabs 
with other details including chart view history (using Highcharts), stock price ranges for the day and latest news about the company.

This implementation uses Javascript to interact with backend and CSS for the front end effects, such as SVGs for effects on images 
and dynamically adding/removing class and innerHTML to replace sections altogether
